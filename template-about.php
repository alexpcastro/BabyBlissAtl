          <h2>Development</h2>
          <p class="lead">Regular massage for infants has been tied to enhanced motor development and language development. Skin sensitivity is a child’s earliest developmental function and massage helps to facilitate body awareness, sensory stimulation, and connection between neurons.</p>
          <p class="lead m-0">Infant Massage is also helpful for newborns that are premature or need additional support and has been shown to boost the immune system, improve blood circulation, balance respiration, and help with waste elimination.</p>

          <h2>Interaction</h2>
          <p class="lead">Infant Massage can contribute to enhanced connection between the child and caregiver. The bonding during this quality time helps build both the baby’s and parent’s confidence by making the child feel loved, nurtured, and calm.</p>
          <p class="lead">This is especially helpful for new fathers or mothers, or parents experiencing post partum depression/traumatic birth experience. Infant Massage also supports the development of feelings such as respect and empathy in the child.</p>

        <p class="lead">The International Association of Infant Massage (IAIM), headquartered in Sweden, emerged in Western culture during the early 1970's as the first association dedicated to Infant Massage education and training for parents, caregivers, and individuals.</p>
        <p class="lead">The Association, founded by Mrs. Vimala McClure, earned a non-profit organization status in 1986 and has remained the pioneering leader in Infant Massage education ever since. With affiliate chapters in many countries around the world, the U.S. held the international office until 1992, when it was moved to Sweden and became an internationally established organization.</p>

The program's theory, curriculum, and focus are unique, and have been carefully refined through research and practical experience since its introduction in 1976.</p>
        <p class="lead">Infant Massage incorporates aspects of Indian and Swedish massage strokes combined with principals from reflexology and yoga.Vimala trained the first IAIM instructor in 1978, around the same time the first IAIM Instructor Handbook was published (Infant Massage, a Handbook for Loving Parents).</p>
